= Demo for setting up a Confluent Cloud dedicated cluster with Private Link for Schema Registry

This demonstrates how to set up a Confluent Cloud dedicated cluster with Private Link

DISCLAIMER: This project is for demonstration purposes only. Using the demo unmodified in production is highly discouraged. Use at your own risk.

## Precondition

You need the following to run this demo:

* A Confluent Cloud Organization.
* A Confluent Cloud API Key with sufficient access permissions to set up a dedicated cluster and an identity provider including identity pools
* Optionally, this demo can generate a certificate authority (CA) and client certificates in PEM as well as JKS format. For the conversion from PEM to JKS, both `openssl` as well as `keytool` need to be installed and in the PATH.

## Getting started


== Wrapping things up

You can destroy all created resources including the cluster in Confluent Cloud by running the following command:

```shell
terraform destroy
```
